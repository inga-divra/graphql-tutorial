# Project Overview

This project is part of a React course and focuses on building a web app using **GraphQL** for fast and flexible data fetching. I learned how to use **Apollo Client** to handle GraphQL queries and caching, which made the app faster and easier to work with.

## What I Learned

- Basics of GraphQL: how to write queries and mutations.
- How to set up Apollo Client to connect React with a GraphQL backend.
- Created a search form that fetches data live.
- Built reusable components like User Profile and Stats.
- Wrote helper functions to handle data.
- Made charts and loading indicators for better user experience.

This project helped me understand how React and GraphQL work well together to manage data smoothly.
